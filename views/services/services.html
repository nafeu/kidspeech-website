<!-- KIDSPEECH™ focuses on childen and adults who have learning disabilities, autism, asperger's syndrome, strokes, literacy/academic issues, cognitive communication problems post an acquired brain injury or concussion, fluency (stuttering or cluttering), developmental problems, myofunctional difficulties (ie drooling), voice disturbances (hoarseness, vocal nodules), or behavioural issues.

<br>
<br>

Specialized training is available to parents who understand the value of our work to help them learn how to promote their baby’s speech and language skills. In other circumstances we work to develop cognitive communication skills. A very important focus is also (pre-reading) literacy skills in the young toddler or school age child who struggles with reading and writing skills. We also address behaviour because it is a large component of frustration in children who struggle with speech and language skills at home or in school. Additionally we also work on memory, expressive language and processing skills in the young and adult. As well, we provide early stimulation intervention and home programmes for parents with babies. Early intervention is key and parental training is most valuable. We also help parents make the best school choice for their children. During the first consultation (approx. 1.5- 2 hours), we review the history, concerns and conduct a comprehensive assessment to obtain an overview of the difficulties. We answer questions and discuss treatment options. Since each client is unique, the approach is tailored to the individual’s needs.

<br>

KIDSPEECH™ can also assist in accent reduction in adults, and provides consultation and treatment to adults who have experienced a stroke or other neurological injury including treatment for comprehension and expression problems.
