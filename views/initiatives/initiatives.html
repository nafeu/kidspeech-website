    <p><a href="http://brasrecycled.com/"><span style="color: rgb(255, 105, 253);">bras</span>recycled.com</a> is a project which Maria started in Toronto over ten years ago. She collects ‘used brassières’ for young girls and women around the globe who are otherwise unable to obtain one.  Since rape has been defined as a ‘power act’,  the simple act of wearing a bra for these young girls and women provides them with increased self-confidence and elevates their status thus reducing their chances of being raped and contracting HIV.</p>
    <p>Over the years Maria has sent thousands of bras to nurses’ and doctors’ offices, as well as high schools in numerous countries Africa, as well as Jamaica, the Phillipines,  Haiti, and Columbia to name a few.</p>
    <p>We have partnered with many organizations who host bra drives to bring awareness to the project so that we can all look into our drawers to find unwanted bras to donate.</p>
    <p>The magazine Neuroconnect whose focus is on rehabilitation and resources for individuals and professionals focussed attention on this initiative through several articles. To read these articles access the Neuroconnect magazine on their website <a target="outside" "="" href="http://www.neuroconnect.ca/">www.neuroconnect.ca</a>.</p>
